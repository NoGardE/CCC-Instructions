May 17 - Election Day
May 18-19 - County clerk should contact you to notify you won
May 27 - Deadline to form County Central Committee

By EOD Thursday (5/19), contact your County Clerk to ask for a list of elected Precinct Committeemen, and to schedule your meeting. Per our bylaws, the meeting must be at the county seat, so coordinate that with your County Clerk.

Meeting to form CCC and elect yourself Chair and State Committeeman/Committeewoman:
	- Call to order
	- Elections:
		- Chair
			1 - Nominate self
			2 - Hold vote
			3 - Vote for self
			4 - Count votes
			5 - Declare self winner
		- State Committeeman
			Same process
		*You must run both elections*
	- Optional: Fill other precinct seats by appointment
		If there are trusted LP Bylaws-Sustaining Members in your county who are also Qualified Electors, you may appoint them as Committeeman for their Precinct. Doing so would make them eligible to be your county's State Committeman or State Committeewoman.
		Do this motion after electing yourself as chair, and before filling other County Central Committee/State Committeeman positions.
		Motion: I move to suspend the rules to appoint First Last as Precinct Committeeman for precinct 12345 to fill the vacancy in that precinct.
		After passing this motion, First Last is now a County Committeeman and participates in votes.
		LP BSM:
