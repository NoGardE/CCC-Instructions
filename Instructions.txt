May 17 - Election Day
May 18-19 - Election results announced
May 27 - Deadline to form County Central Committee
May 28 - Deadline to form Legislative District Central Committee

County Central Committee: By EOD Thursday (5/19), get election results from your county and LD to find all elected PC's. If you need their contact info and we don't have it internally, contact the County Clerk for it. Per our bylaws, the meeting must be at the county seat, before May 27, so schedule it there, and then immediately notify all county PC's.

Legislative District Central Committee: If your Legislative District is in multiple counties, get a list of PC's in each county, within your LD (you may need to contact the county clerks to find out which precincts are in your LD). Schedule your LDCC meeting at some point before May 28, at some place in your LD. It need not be at any particular place, except that such a place needs to be in one of the counties in your LD, or in a District that's "contiguous to" your LD. We recommend doing it on the same day as the County Central Committee, at your County seat, for simplicity and a guaranteed valid location. As with CCC, notify any relevant PC's immediately.

National Convention starts on 5/27, so plan to have your Central Committee meetings before leaving for National. If you're the only PC in your County/LD, do it as soon as results are announced. Otherwise, do it as soon as you can meet up.

Agenda to adopt to accomplish this:

	- Adoption of Agenda
	- County Central Committee Officer Elections
		- Chair
		- Vice-Chair
		- Secretary
		- State Committeeman
		- State Committeewoman

Legislative District Central Committee:
	- Call to order

Record minutes, Secretary send full minutes to LPID Exec Board and to all PC's in the County/LD. Once that is done, the Chairs, State Committeemen, and State Committeewomen, each as individuals hold a seat on the State Central Committee (no duplicate votes on SCC for holding multiple positions). This is where the fun begins.
